Description:

This is a simple program which helps to manage a stock portfolio. It uses a text based user interface which automatically clears after each menu choice to help eliminate clutter from the command line interface.  The main menu has five menu options:  Stock price look-up, Showing the current portfolio, Buying a stock to add to the portfolio, selling a stockto remove it from the portfolio, and an option to exit the program. The program uses a dictionary created and managed within the main program to help keep track of the portfolio. Additionally, the program writes to a CSV to provide long time storage of the portfolio information.

Upon start up, the program first checks to determine if a portfolio csv files exists and prompts the user that one was created if it did not exit. The program automatically generates the portfolio dictionary if a csv file was found in the same directory. I chose to use a graphical grid format for the main menu for readablility to make the user interface look nicer.

If a user chooses stock look-up they are prompted to enter a stock symbol. That stock symbol is sent to a function which calls an API from yahoo finance is called to a dictionary is returned if the stock symbol is valid. The return dictionary is parsed to locate the current stock price and it is returned to the main function to be printed to the user. If a stock symbol without a current price or an invalid stock symbol is entered, the function handles the exception and returns a 0.0 or -1.0 for interphetation from the main program through a nested conditional.

If a user choose the purchase option, they are prompted to enter a stock symbol and it is checked for a current price using the previously mentioned API. The user is presented with the current price and are prompted for the quanity of shares purchased. The current portfolio, stock symbol, quantity of shares purchased, and current price are passed to a function to update the portfolio. The called purchase function gets the current date through a library, and appends the portfolio with the information. The function returns a successful message to the user once the appending of the portfolio is complete. The program then re-writes the csv file with the updated portfolio information to ensure long-term integrity of the data.

If a user choose the sell option, they are prompted to enter a stock symbol. The stock symbol entered and the portfolio are passed to a sell function which checks entered symbol against the current portfolio and removes the data from the portfolio if it is located. No changes are made to the portfolio is the entered stock symbol is not part of the current portfolio. The function returns a boolean which represents if the entered stock symbol was part of the current portfolio and is interpetred by the main function. The user is then informed of the success regarding the removal of the stock from the portfolio. The program then re-writes the csv file with the updated portfolio information to ensure long-term integrity of the data.

Additionally, I created a requirements.txt file which outlines the numerous python libraries which I utilized during the creation of this project.  I have also kept a csv file which includes some sample data generated by the program for the purposes of testing and reviewing.

I really enjoyed this project, I spent a while trying to determine the best way to maintian and pass around the portfolio data. I spent a while tying to work with the portfolio as a class dict, but never found a suitable way to appending data to the class dict after initialization. This is likely due to my admittedly limited experience with python. However, I found the solution of keeping the dict as a local variable in main to be the most elegant. I also strugged with wanting to keep more of the code in each individual function, but quickly realized that it would be near impossible to generate assertions and return functionality if I did not streamline what each function was responsbile for doing.

I acknowledge the code is not perfect, and a more experineced developer could likely find many improvements to the code, but I set out to write a program to give me more experience regarding the use of APIs, working with dict variable types, and working with file I/O and believe this program provided with much success in meeting those goals.
